# Running the code locally
* It is assumed that the user has [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed in the local system.


* Step 1 : Clone the repository to your local system.
* Step 2 : In the terminal change the current directory to project directory which contains the Go snippets.
* Step 3 : Now to run the code enter the following command : ```go run filename.go```
[where filename is the name of the Go File]
