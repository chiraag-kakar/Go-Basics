# Go-Basics
This repository contains the basic snippets I have practiced in Go language

---
# Running the code locally
* It is assumed that the user has [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed in the local system.


* Step 1 : Clone the repository to your local system.
* Step 2 : In the terminal change the current directory to project directory which contains the Go snippets.
* Step 3 : Now to run the code enter the following command : ```go run filename.go```
* Step 4 : To build the programs into binaries enter the following command : ```go build filename.go```
* Step 5 : To run the binary file enter the following command in the same directory : ```./filename```

* [where [filename]() is the name of the Go File]
